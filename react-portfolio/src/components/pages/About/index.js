            <p> My my full name is, Jovan Dupree Norrington Jr. I was born on the 15th of January in the year 1999.
I'm 22 :) I started messing with code when I was younger making bot scripts and things on online games I use to play like ClubPenguin.
I'm currently learning html,css, javascript, and much more. Coding is so exciting and i'm glad im taking this leap into the field.
My older sister conviced me to enroll in these courses and, I know I wont regret my choice!
I've been thinking a lot and the company I would want to work for the most is Microsoft!</p>
